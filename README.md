### Mod 2 Paired Project: Relational Rails
### Chaz Simons & Sam Devine
---

The goal of this project is to begin exploring the Rails environment, including MVC and ORMs, ActiveRecord associations, and model and feature testing.

We have designed a simple database schema (as seen below) with several data types. These tables represent two one-to-many relationships between restaurants (with many employees) and customers (with many orders).
